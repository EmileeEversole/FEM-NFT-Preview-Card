### What I learned

This is my third Frontend Mentor challenge, and it's the second one I've completed today (August 3, 2023). I'm becoming more confident in my responsiveness skills, especially since I'm starting to think ahead and keep it in mind while I'm coding. When I was almost done and it was time to start testing the responsiveness of the page, I found myself thanking "past" me for thinking ahead! However, I forgot to look at what the active statuses were supposed to look like, so I didn't add the HTML for them until about halfway through, which was frustrating. 

I estimated that this project would take approximately 3 hours to complete, and I got it done in around 2hrs 50min. 

### Continued development

I will continue to work on my overall skills and becoming more comfortable with code. I think I may do a few more purely CSS/HTML challenges, and then start testing my JS skills! 

I did well in my time estimation, but the project shouldn't have taken 3 hours. I will definitely continue to work on my efficiency and work towards eliminating unnecessary time-wasters, which I think will partly come with time and experience.
